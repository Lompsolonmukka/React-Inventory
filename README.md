<h3>First touch to a React build.</h3>

Done:

- Database JSON
- Adding item function
- Search function


In the future:

- error handling
- app UI design
- possibly ways to print the returned search array to a spreadsheet etc.
- deleting item from the database
- table list page system and scrolling
